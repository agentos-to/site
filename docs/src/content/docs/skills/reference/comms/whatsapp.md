## Returns shapes

- [`conversation`](/shapes/reference/conversation/) — from `get_conversation`
- [`conversation[]`](/shapes/reference/conversation/) — from `list_conversations`
- [`message`](/shapes/reference/message/) — from `get_message`
- [`message[]`](/shapes/reference/message/) — from `list_messages`, `search_messages`
- [`person[]`](/shapes/reference/person/) — from `list_persons`

## Readme

Read and send WhatsApp messages through a live WhatsApp Web tab. Ops run as
JS payloads in the engine-owned Brave instance via the `browser_session`
capability — the engine holds the CDP session; this skill never sees the
protocol. WhatsApp's own code decrypts everything; the payloads read the
in-page Store collections.

## Requirements

- **Brave Browser** installed (the engine launches its own instance with a
  dedicated profile at `~/.agentos/browsers/brave`)
- **One-time link**: on first use the engine opens web.whatsapp.com — scan
  the QR code with your phone (Settings → Linked Devices). The session
  persists in the engine-owned profile; ops return `NeedsAuth` until linked.

## IDs

All ids are WhatsApp JIDs: `15125555309@c.us` (person), `…@g.us` (group).
Every op that takes a chat accepts a JID **or a fuzzy name substring**
("vibe coders" finds the group).

## Common Tasks

- **Active chats:** `list_conversations` (non-archived, most recent first)
- **Archived chats:** `list_conversations` with `archived: true`
- **Unread messages:** `list_messages` with `is_unread: true`
- **Chat history:** `list_messages` with `conversation_id` — pages earlier
  history into memory until `limit` is reached
- **Group members:** `list_persons` with `conversation_id` (opens the chat
  to trigger WhatsApp's lazy participant load — takes a few seconds)
- **Send:** `send_message` with `to` + `text`
- **React:** `send_reaction` with `chat` + `emoji` (any Unicode emoji)

## Behavior notes

- `search_messages` searches the **in-memory** Store — recent history per
  chat, not the full archive. For deep history, `list_messages` the
  conversation first to page more into memory.
- First op after an engine restart is slow (~10-30s): browser launch + page
  load + Store init. Warm ops run in well under a second.
- Media messages map with `type` (`image`, `video`, `ptt`, …) and use the
  caption as `content`; media payloads themselves are not downloaded.
- Meta AI responses (`rich_response` type) have their text extracted from
  response fragments automatically.

## Entity Model

- **person** — the human, with name and phone from WhatsApp contacts
- **account** — their WhatsApp identity (JID), on `person.accounts` /
  `message.from` / `conversation.participant`
- **conversation** — a chat thread (`isGroup`, `isArchived`, `unreadCount`)
- **message** — `content`, `published`, `isOutgoing`, `author`,
  `conversationId`, `type`

## Internals (for maintainers)

Payloads use WhatsApp Web's module system: `WAWebCollections` (Chat / Msg /
Contact), `WAWebChatLoadMessages.loadEarlierMsgs`, `WAWebSendMsgChatAction.
addAndSendMsgToChat`, `WAWebSendReactionMsgAction.sendReactionToMsg`,
`WAWebCmd.openChatAt`, `WAWebUserPrefsMeUser.getMeUser` (login probe).
Model fields carry the `__x_` prefix. The full verified API map lives in
`core/_roadmap/p1/whatsapp-live/research.md`. If WhatsApp ships a breaking
Web update, that map plus the whatsapp-web.js project are the references
for re-deriving module names.
